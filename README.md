## üìò Design Decisions & Challenges

- **React Native with Expo** was selected for its beginner-friendly setup and fast development experience. It simplified the configuration and allowed focus on building features without worrying about native environment setup.

- **Redux Toolkit with RTK Query** was used to manage global state and handle mock API calls. This approach ensured clean separation of data fetching logic and helped with caching and reusability across screens.

- All API data (e.g., recent transfers, bank list, favourites) is mocked using local JSON files to simulate a realistic backend experience without requiring a server.

- Both **transfer by account number** and **transfer by mobile number** flows were implemented, each with its own validation logic (e.g., bank-specific account length rules, mobile number formatting, etc.).

- A **session timeout handler** was implemented using a full-screen modal. It detects user inactivity using `AppState`, `Keyboard` events, and `PanResponder` to cover both mobile and web activity. Users are given a countdown before being logged out.

- **Biometric authentication** was added after PIN entry using Expo's local authentication module. If the device doesn't support biometrics, the flow falls back to PIN-based login.

### Challenges Faced

- Ensuring **inactivity detection** worked consistently across platforms was a key challenge. Web requires DOM event listeners, while mobile platforms needed gesture detection using `PanResponder`. Combining both approaches took some fine-tuning.

- The **countdown timer** in the session timeout modal initially froze due to state and interval conflicts. This was resolved by carefully managing timer references and visibility state.

- Validating **account number formats** based on different banks required adding custom rules in the form logic, ensuring users can't proceed with invalid inputs.

- When syncing device contacts, extra handling was added to avoid duplicate entries. A unique key was generated by combining contact ID and cleaned phone number to ensure proper rendering.
